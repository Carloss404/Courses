## Get to Know Google Ads

### Your advertising campaigns should center around the objectives you have for your business. Take a look at how Google Ads can fuel your business goals

### To help you grow your business, Google Ads is built around three principles: relevance, control, and results.

**Relevance:** Google Ads helps you connect with the right people, at the right time, with the right message. Your ads can appear on Google Search, YouTube, and more, just when someone is looking for products or services like yours. You can also customize options, such as keywords and location, to get in front of the most relevant customers.

**Control:** Google Ads gives you complete control over your budget. You can choose how much to spend per month, per day, and per ad. Based on your settings, Google Ads uses a lighting-fast auction to determine which ad to show. If you want to change your strategy, you can easily adjust your ad, modify your budget, or pause and restart a campaign.

**Results:** Pay only for results, like clicks to your website or calls to your business. Our measurement tools make it easy to see how your site, apps, and ads are performing. Plus, smart technology lets you create, manage, and optimize your campaigns so you can get the most out of your investment.

## Support Your Business Goal with Google Ads

### Google Ads Campaign Types:

**Search:** Search ads appear next to Google search results and on other Google partner sites, like YouTube, when people look for business like yours. With a search campaign, you can make sure potential customers notice your brand, consider your products, and take actions.

**Display:** Google Display ads can appear across a network of more than two million sites and apps, reaching 90% of people on the internet. Your ads get matched to content related to your business or to your customers' interests. Use a display campaign to increase exposure and reach audiences with specific interests across the web.

**Video:** With Video ads, you can reach the right audience at scale and capture their attention. Show your ads on their own or within other streaming video content on YouTube and across Google's network of websites and apps. Only pay when people choose to watch your ad. Video campaigns help you bring your business's story to life. They engage customers in different ways, like showing ads before their favorite music video or while they're researching an upcoming purchase.

**App:** After a simple setup process, App campaigns run ads across Google's largest properties, including Search, Play, and YouTube, as well as thousands of mobile sites and apps. Your ads and bids are automatically adjusted to get the most downloads. Just add a few lines of text, a bid, and some assets, and the rest is optimized to help customers find you. With an App campaign, you can increase engagement, app installs, and even in-app actions, like signing up for a newsletter or ordering a product.

### Specialized campaign types:

**Local:** Local campaigns help you drive important offline metrics - like store visits or in-store sales - by advertising on multiple platforms. Let Google Ads optimize how your ads appear on Search, Maps, Display, and YouTube to maximize your offline performance.
