## Display Ad Formats

Creatives are the face of your brand through advertising, so you want to make sure they represent you well. Ad formats let you choose how to communicate your business to your audience.

### **Why Display Ad Formats?**
Display ads can help you promote your business when people are browsing online, watching YouTube videos, or using mobile devices and apps. With Google Display ads, you can take an approach that enables greater efficiency or greater creative control.

**Efficiency:** If Hiroko values performance over everything else, she should take advantage of Responsive Display Ads (RDA). This ad format automatically adjusts to the available ad space. RDAs can also run in native and non-native inventory.

**Control:** Hiroko takes her branding very seriously. If she has exact requirements for how and where her ads show, it may be best to create and upload her own ads. But while this option provides more control, it might also limit her reach -- uploaded ads don't have access to the same inventory as RDAs.

## Responsive Display Ads

Responsive Display Ads (RDA) are Google's marquee Display ad format and the default ad type when creating a Display campaign. They represent the future of asset-based digital advertising.

### **Whare are Responsive Display Ads?**
RDAs lets you upload your own assets and create ads that serve in all ad slot sizes, into both native and non-native inventory. Just upload your assets (images, videos, headlines, logos, and descriptions), and Google automatically creates the ads. They're built for performance, reach, and scale.

**Automation:** When you create a Responsive Display Ad by uploading different assets into Google Ads, Google uses a machine learning model to determine the optimal combination of assets for each ad slot based on predictions built from your performance history.

**Reach:** Multiple assets can be uploaded per asset type, such as headlines, logos, images, and videos. The ads that Google assembles automatically adjust their size, appearance, and format to fit just about any native or non-native ad slot.

**Simplicity:** By using Responsive Display Ads, you can reduce your overhead for managing ad portfolios within ad groups and campaigns and dedicate more time to performance improvement.

## Uploaded ads

Uploaded ads offer greater control over the way your ads look and feel. You build your own ads outside of Google Ads and simply upload them to your Display campaign.

### **What are Image Ads?**
Created outside of Google Ads (in Google Web Designer, for example), image ads are uploadable as a .zip file into Google Ads. Image ads run in banner-eligible slots, which has limited scale relative to Responsive Display Ads.

### **What are AMPHTML Ads?**
AMPHTML ads enable marketers, publishers, and technology providers to deliver faster, more secure ad experiences across all platforms by applying the principles of AMP to building and serving ads.
