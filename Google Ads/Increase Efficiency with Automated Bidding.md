Bidding is a key success factor for online marketing, and the bid strategy you choose directly influences how your campaigns perform and how visible your ads are in the unique moments that are important to your business. Google Ads automated bidding is an enterprise-class solution that helps advertisers automatically set bids based on performance goals.

#### **What's automated bidding?**

**Performance:** Bids influence how visible your ads are and the amount of interaction you get in each unique moment. If you don't bid efficiently, you could miss valuable conversions.

**Auctions:** Given the dynamic nature of our auctions, the appropriate bid can often be a moving target that's challenging to reach at scale when using manual bidding.

**User Journey Complexities:** Many signals influence user behavior. Their intent and likelihood to complete valuable actions for your business vary based on location, time, device, and so on. Taking all these signals into account for every auction and bidding can be done through automation.

#### **Benefits of Google Ads Smart Bidding**

The goal of any marketing campaign is to reach the right user with the right message at the right time. As consumers span across multiple devices, the customer journey has become more complex and so has setting bids based on user's context.

Google Ads automated bidding helps solve this challenge by automatically setting bids based on performance goals. Smart bidding is a set of automated bidding strategies that use machine learning to optimize for conversion value. Smart Bidding sets precise bids for each and every auction to help drive higher conversion volume or conversion value at a cost efficiency that is comparable to or better than existing performance goals.

**Machine learning:** Automated bidding uses machine learning to algorithmically help you set the appropriate bid for each and every auction. This takes much of the heavy lifting and guesswork out of setting bids, so you can meet your performance goals more efficiently and accurately.

**Time saved:** Cross-referencing audience data with context to establish intent and set the appropriate bid is a complex and time-consuming task. Automation offers a way to alleviate this strain on marketing resources.

**Auction-time bidding:** Our bidding algorithms tailor bids to each user's unique context, using relevant signals present at auction time. This is a unique capability in the market, as it allows for bid differentiation, with a high degree of precision based on the conversion opportunity of each auction.

**Depths of signals used and cross analysis:** Our algorithms integrate a large variety of signals and consider new ones to evaluate user intent. They also go a step beyond traditional signal analysis by recognizing and adjusting for meaningful interactions between combinations of signals while constantly considering new ones.
