## Display Advertising on Google Display Ads

With Google Display ads as your ally, you can reach over **90% of global internet users across more than three millions apps and websites.** This kind of reach allows you to learn about customer behavior, identify valuable audiences, and engage with those audiences quickly and often.

**Display campaigns are where you set how, when, and where your ads show. There are two types of Display campaigns: Standard Display campaigns and Smart Display campaigns.**

## Display Campaign Types

### **What's a Smart Display campaign?**

Smart Display campaigns are a campaign type that uses full automation. It bundles together all the pillars of successful Display campaigns and accesses the best of Google's machine learning capabilities to optimize and automate nearly all aspects of your Display campaigns. You provide a few inputs: what your ads will say, images you want to use, daily budget, and cost-per-acquisition (CPA) performance targets. Google will mix and match your ads at scale.

Smart Display campaigns rely on the existing CPA model to set the bids at the right time. They also use a new auto-targeting infrastructure to deliver the best of Display targeting across the entire mid- and lower-funnel, and leverage a new auto-optimized creative technology to combine raw creative assets (logos and images), and build custom ads for each auction.

### **Components of Smart Display campaigns**

**Automated bidding:** Instead of bidding manually, you specify a Target CPA or Target ROAS you'd like to achieve and Google will manage the CPC bids on a per-auction basis, based on the likelihood that the auction will generate a conversion.

**Automated targeting:** Targeting optimizes where the campaigns runs, which means ads increasingly show where they'll get you the most business. Smart Display campaigns drive marketing and prospecting alike.

**Automated creatives:** Ads are automatically generated from the building blocks you provide, like headlines, descriptions, logos, and images. They responsively fit into almost all ad slots across Google Display ads.

### **What's a Standard Display Campaign?**

#### **Targeting**
- **Build awareness:** Increase how well people know your brand.

- **Maximize Conversions:** Drive as much as volume as possible within your budget
- **Target CPA:** Automatically sets bids to help you increase conversions while reaching your average cost-per-acquisition goal.
- **Target ROAS:** Automatically sets bids to help get as much conversion value as possible at the target return on ad spend you set.
